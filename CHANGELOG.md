## 0.32.0 (Unreleased)

BREAKING CHANGES:
* **Removed Authentication Method**: Host-specific TF_TOKEN_... environment variable can no longer be used for token authentication. This method of authentication is incompatible with the Terraform Cloud remote execution model. Please use the TFE_TOKEN environment variable.

BUG FIXES:
* Prevent overwriting `vcs_repo` attributes in `r/tfe_workspace` when update API call fails ([#498](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-tfe/pull/498))

FEATURES:
* r/team, d/team: Add manage_run_tasks to the tfe_team organization_access attributes ([#486](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-tfe/pull/486))

BREAKING CHANGES:
* r/tfe_workspace: Default value of the `file_triggers_enabled` field is changed to `false`. This will align the
  `file_triggers_enabled` field default value with the default value for the same field in the 
  [TFC API](https://www.terraform.io/cloud-docs/api-docs/workspaces).
  If the value of the `file_triggers_enabled` field was not explicitly set and either of the fields `working_directory`
  (not an empty string) or `trigger_prefixes` was used - to keep the behavior unchanged, the `file_trigger_enabled` 
  field should now explicitly be set to `true`. ([#510](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-tfe/pull/510/files))

## 0.31.0 (April 21, 2022)

BUG FIXES:
* Sensitive values within certain Authorization headers are now redacted from TRACE and DEBUG logs ([#479](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-tfe/pull/479))
* r/tfe_variable_set: Clarified and fixed variable_set documentation and examples ([#473](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-tfe/pull/473)) and ([#472](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-tfe/pull/472))

FEATURES:
* r/team, d/team: Add sso_team_id to the tfe_team attributes ([#457](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-tfe/pull/457))
* **New Authentication Method**: Host-specific TF_TOKEN_... variable can be used for token authentication. See provider documentation for details. ([#477](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-tfe/pull/477))

## 0.30.2 (April 01, 2022)

BUG FIXES:
* r/tfe_variable_set: Fixed import documentation and examples ([#466](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-tfe/pull/466))
* r/tfe_variable: Fixed import documentation and examples ([#466](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-tfe/pull/466))

## 0.30.1 (April 01, 2022)

BUG FIXES:

* r/tfe_variable_set: Fixed examples in documentation for variable_set_id ([#462](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-tfe/pull/462))

## 0.30.0 (March 29, 2022)

FEATURES:
* **New Resource**: `tfe_variable` ([#452](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-tfe/pull/452))
* **New Resource**: `tfe_variable_set` ([#452](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-tfe/pull/452))
* **New Data Sources**: d/tfe_variable_set, d/tfe_variables ([#452](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-tfe/pull/452))

## 0.29.0 (March 24, 2022)

BUG FIXES:
* r/ssh_key: Removed ability to update ssh value, which never worked ([#432](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-tfe/pull/432))

ENHANCEMENTS:
* r/team: Add `manage_providers` and `manage_modules` attributes to resource schema ([#431](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-tfe/pull/431))
* Update go-tfe dependency to version 1.0.0 ([#450](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-tfe/pull/450))

## 0.28.1 (February 04, 2022)

BUG FIXES:

  Terraform versions ([#427](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-tfe/pull/427))

## 0.28.0 (February 02, 2022)

FEATURES:
* **New Resource**: `tfe_terraform_version` ([#400](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-tfe/pull/400))
* **New Resource**: `tfe_organization_module_sharing` ([#425](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-tfe/pull/425))

ENHANCEMENTS:
* r/workspace: Add support for importing workspaces using <ORGANIZATION NAME>/<WORKSPACE NAME> pair ([#401](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-tfe/pull/401))
* r/team: Show entitlement error when creating teams ([#418](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-tfe/pull/418))
* Bump `go-tfe` dependency to `0.24.0`

BUG FIXES:
* d/workspace_ids: Fix plugin crash when providing empty strings to `names` argument ([#421](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-tfe/pull/421))
* r/workspace: Fix `trigger_prefixes` and `remote_state_consumer_ids` were appearing as workspace drift after being defaulted by the API to empty lists ([#423](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-tfe/pull/423))

## 0.27.1 (January 25, 2022)

BUG FIXES:
* d/workspace: Fixed an issue with remote state consumers were being populated with all workspaces when
  global_remote_state is true. When global_remote_state is true, it's safe to assume that all workspace
  state can be read ([#414](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-tfe/pull/414))

## 0.27.0 (December 15, 2021)

FEATURES:
* **New Data Source:** d/tfe_variables ([#369](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-tfe/pull/369))

ENHANCEMENTS:
* r/organization: Added
  `send_passing_statuses_for_untriggered_speculative_plans`, which can be useful if large numbers of
  untriggered workspaces are exhausting request limits for connected version control service
  providers like GitHub. ([#386](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-tfe/pull/386))
* r/oauth_client: Added `key`, `secret`, and `rsa_public_key` arguments, used for configuring
  BitBucket Server and Azure DevOps Server. ([#395](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-tfe/pull/395))
* Improved discovery and loading of credentials from Terraform configuration files; the provider
  will attempt to use Terraform CLI's authentication with Terraform Cloud/Enterprise for its own
  authentication, when present. ([#360](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-tfe/pull/360))

BUG FIXES:
* r/workspace: Fixed an issue with remote state consumer relationships on workspaces where the provider would not
  follow pagination and only the first 20 results would be read correctly. ([#367](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-tfe/pull/367))
* r/tfe_variable: Fixed an issue where updating sensitive attributes would just surface the
  underlying correct error (they must be recreated) instead of allowing Terraform to intelligently
  replace the resource as part of its execution plan. ([#394](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-tfe/pull/394))

## 0.26.1 (September 04, 2021)

BUG FIXES:
* Fixed a regression introduced in 0.26.0 where explicitly specifying a hostname became erroneously required, when it should
  default to app.terraform.io (Terraform Cloud) ([#354](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-tfe/pull/354))
* d/workspace_ids: Fixed issue with `names` and `tag_names` not validating correctly ([#358](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-tfe/pull/358))

## 0.26.0 (September 02, 2021)

FEATURES:
* **New Data Sources:** d/tfe_organizations, d/tfe_organization [#320](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-tfe/pull/320).
* Add support for enabling structured run outputs in a `tfe_workspace` [#330](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-tfe/pull/330).
* **New Data Source**: Introduces `tfe_slug` used to represent configuration files.
  on local file system [#333](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-tfe/pull/333).
* Add functionality in `tfe_policy_set` to allow uploading of local policies [#333](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-tfe/pull/333).
* **New Data Source**: Introduces `tfe_outputs` to retrieve state outputs for a Workspace.
* r/workspace: Added `tag_names` argument to set tags for a Workspace.
* d/workspace: Added `tag_names` to the data returned for a Workspace.
* d/workspace_ids: Added `tag_names` as a search option to find Workspaces by tag name.

ENHANCEMENTS:
* Use Golang 1.17 [#341](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-tfe/pull/341).

## 0.25.3 (May 18, 2021)

BUG FIXES:
* d/ip_ranges: Fixes an issue in the upstream client where accessing this datasource would
  erroneously change the state of the client and cause subsequent requests in plans to fail with
  incorrect URLs. [#316](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-tfe/pull/316)

## 0.25.2 (May 06, 2021)

BUG FIXES:
d/tfe_workspace: Fix remote state consumer regression for Terraform Enterprise ([#311](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-tfe/pull/311))

NOTES:
* This release includes an additional fix for the regression introduced in v0.25.0
  to address errors for anyone using the `tfe_workspace` data source with a Terraform
  Enterprise version earlier than v20210401-1.


## 0.25.1 (April 30, 2021)

BUG FIXES:
* r/workspace: Fix remote state consumer regression for Terraform Enterprise ([#303](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-tfe/pull/303))
* r/organization: Ignore diffs in name case sensitivity ([#300](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-tfe/pull/300))

NOTES:
* This release includes a fix for a major regression from a backwards incompatible change
  erroneously introduced in v0.25.0, where any Terraform Enterprise version < v20210401-1 would
  experience failures using the tfe_workspace resource.

## 0.25.0 (April 29, 2021)

BREAKING CHANGES:
* d/tfe_workspace: Removed deprecated `external_id` attribute. Use `id` instead ([#295](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-tfe/pull/295))
* d/tfe_workspace_ids: Removed deprecated `external_ids` attribute. Use `ids` instead ([#295](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-tfe/pull/295))
* r/tfe_workspace: Removed deprecated `external_id` attribute. Use `id` instead ([#295](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-tfe/pull/295))

ENHANCEMENTS:
* Use Go 1.16 to provide support for Apple Silicon (darwin/arm64) ([#288](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-tfe/pull/288))
* Add Manage Policy Overrides permission for teams ([#285](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-tfe/pull/285))
* r/tfe_workspace: Add remote state consumer functionality ([#292](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-tfe/pull/292))
* r/tfe_workspace: Added description parameter to TFE workspace ([#271](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-tfe/pull/271))
* d/tfe_workspace: Added new workspace fields from the API ([#287](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-tfe/pull/287))
* d/tfe_workspace: Added `branch` attribute to `vcs_repo` block ([#290](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-tfe/pull/290))
* Improved error message for missing token ([#273](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-tfe/pull/273))

NOTES:
* You will need to migrate to the new attributes in your configuration to update to the latest
  version of this provider. The tfe_workspace resource will continue to migrate old workspace
  resources in state (schema version 0, using `external_id`) to new ones (schema version 1, using `id`) for
  the foreseeable future and will only be removed in a breaking major version (likely v1.0.0). More information
  about these deprecations can be found in the description of [#295](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-tfe/pull/295)

## 0.24.0 (January 22, 2021)

BREAKING CHANGES:
* Support for Terraform version 0.11 and prior has ended. Terraform version 0.12+ is required. This is a result of
  updating the provider to use version 2.0 of the [Terraform Plugin SDK](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-sdk) ([#246](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-tfe/pull/246))
* d/tfe_workspace_ids: Changed `ids` attribute to return immutable workspace IDs (`ws-<RANDOM STRING>`) ([#253](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-tfe/pull/253))
* r/tfe_notification_configuration: Removed deprecated `workspace_external_id` attribute, preferring `workspace_id` instead ([#253](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-tfe/pull/253))
* r/tfe_policy_set: Removed deprecated `workspace_external_ids` attribute, preferring `workspace_ids` instead ([#253](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-tfe/pull/253))
* r/tfe_run_trigger: Removed deprecated `workspace_external_id` attribute, preferring `workspace_id` instead ([#253](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-tfe/pull/253))

FEATURES:
* **New Resource:** r/tfe_agent_token ([#259](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-tfe/pull/259))
* **New Data Source:** d/tfe_ip_ranges ([#262](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-tfe/pull/262))

ENHANCEMENTS:
* d/tfe_workspace: Added deprecation warning to the `external_id` attribute, preferring `id` instead ([#253](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-tfe/pull/253))
* d/tfe_workspace_ids: Added deprecation warning to the `external_ids` attribute, preferring `ids` instead ([#253](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-tfe/pull/253))
* r/tfe_workspace: Added deprecation warning to the `external_id` attribute, preferring `id` instead ([#253](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-tfe/pull/253))

NOTES:
* All deprecated attributes will be removed 3 months after the release of v0.24.0 (April 21, 2021). After this
  deprecation period, you will need to migrate to the preferred attributes to update to the latest version of this
  provider. More information about these deprecations can be found in the description of [#253](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-tfe/pull/253)
* d/tfe_workspace: The deprecation warning for the `external_id` attribute will not go away until the attribute is
  removed in a future version.  This is due to a [limitation of the Terraform
  SDK](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/7569) for deprecation warnings on attributes that aren't specified
  in a configuration. If you have already changed all references to this data source's `external_id` attribute to the
  `ids` attribute, you can ignore the warning.
* d/tfe_workspace_ids: The deprecation warning for the `external_ids` attribute will not go away until the attribute is
  removed in a future version.  This is due to a [limitation of the Terraform
  SDK](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/7569) for deprecation warnings on attributes that aren't specified
  in a configuration. If you have already changed all references to this data source's `external_ids` attribute to the
  `ids` attribute, you can ignore the warning.


## 0.23.0 (November 20, 2020)

FEATURES:
* **New Resource:** r/tfe_agent_pool ([#242](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-tfe/pull/242)) Includes
  the ability to import existing agent pools via ID.
* **New Data Source:** d/tfe_agent_pool ([#242](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-tfe/pull/242))

ENHANCEMENTS:
* r/tfe_workspace: Added `execution_mode` argument, succeeding the existing `operations` boolean (which is now
  deprecated) ([#242](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-tfe/pull/242)) This new argument, along with
  `agent_pool_id`, allows for configuring workspaces to use Terraform Cloud Agents
  (https://www.terraform.io/docs/cloud/agents).
* r/tfe_workspace: Added `allow_destroy_plan`, which determines if destroy plans can be queued on the workspace ([#245](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-tfe/pull/245))
* r/tfe_organization: Added `cost_estimation_enabled`, which determines if the cost estimation feature is enabled for all workspaces in the organization. ([#239](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-tfe/pull/239))
* Added provider configuration option `ssl_skip_verify`, to allow users to skip certificate verifications if their
  environment is appropriate for it (note that in general, this is not recommended and the default value of `true`
  should be used). ([#95](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-tfe/pull/95))

BUG FIXES:
* r/tfe_team_access: Fixed an erroneous error message seen when a workspace could not be retrieved from the API ([#233](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-tfe/pull/233))

NOTES:
  * Go 1.14 is now being used for development, along with Go modules.
  * Several documentation improvements have been made in this release.

## 0.22.0 (October 07, 2020)

FEATURES:
* **New Data Source:** d/tfe_oauth_client ([#212](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-tfe/pull/212))

ENHANCEMENTS:
* r/tfe_variable: Changes to the key of a sensitive variable will result in the deletion of the old variable and the creation of a new one ([#175](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-tfe/pull/175))
* r/tfe_workspace: Adds support for the speculative_enabled argument to tfe_workspace ([#210](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-tfe/pull/210))

BUG FIXES:
* r/tfe_registry_module: Prevent a possible race condition when creating modules in the registry. ([#215](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-tfe/pull/215))
* r/tfe_run_trigger: Retry when a "locked" error is returned ([#178](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-tfe/pull/178))
* r/tfe_workspace: Fixed a logic bug that prevented non-default branch names to be imported. ([#220](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-tfe/pull/220))
* r/tfe_workspace: Prevent the provider from crashing when encountering empty trigger prefixes. ([#223](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-tfe/pull/223))
* r/tfe_workspace_variable: Remove the variable from the state if the workspace containing it has been deleted via the UI. ([#227](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-tfe/pull/227))

## 0.21.0 (August 19, 2020)

ENHANCEMENTS:
* r/tfe_policy_set: Added a validation for the `name` attribute so that invalid policy set names are caught at plan time ([#168](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-tfe/pull/168))

NOTES:
* This validation matches the requirements specified by the [Terraform Cloud API](https://www.terraform.io/docs/cloud/api/policy-sets.html#request-body). Policy set names can only include letters, numbers, -, and \_.

## 0.20.0 (July 17, 2020)

FEATURES:
* **New Resource:** r/tfe_registry_module ([#191](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-tfe/pull/191))
* **New Data Source:** d/tfe_organization_membership ([#191](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-tfe/pull/191))

ENHANCEMENTS:
* r/tfe_notification_configuration: Added support for email notification configuration by adding support for `destination_type` of `email` and associated schema attributes `email_user_ids` and (TFE only) `email_addresses` ([#191](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-tfe/pull/191))
* r/tfe_organization_membership: Added ability to import organization memberships and added new computed attribute `user_id` ([#191](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-tfe/pull/191))

NOTES:
* Using `destination_type` of `email` with resource `tfe_notification_configuration` requires using the provider with Terraform Cloud or an instance of Terraform Enterprise at least as recent as v202005-1.

## 0.19.0 (June 17, 2020)

FEATURES:
* r/tfe_team_access and d/tfe_team_access: Added support for custom workspace permissions ([#184](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-tfe/pull/184))

BUG FIXES:
* r/tfe_policy_set: Fixes issue when updating Policy Set branch attribute ([#185](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-tfe/pull/185))

## 0.18.1 (June 10, 2020)

ENHANCEMENTS:
* provider: Updated terraform-provider-sdk to 1.13.1 ([[#177](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-tfe/pull/177)])

## 0.18.0 (June 03, 2020)

ENHANCEMENTS:
* d/tfe_workspace_ids: Added deprecation warning to the `ids` attribute, preferring `full_names` instead ([#182](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-tfe/pull/182))
* r/tfe_notification_configuration: Added deprecation warning to the `workspace_external_id` attribute, preferring `workspace_id` instead ([#182](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-tfe/pull/182))
* r/tfe_policy_set: Added deprecation warning to the `workspace_external_ids` attribute, preferring `workspace_ids` instead ([#182](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-tfe/pull/182))
* r/tfe_run_trigger: Added deprecation warning to the `workspace_external_id` attribute, preferring `workspace_id` instead ([#182](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-tfe/pull/182))

NOTES:
* All deprecated attributes will be removed 3 months after the release of v0.18.0. You will have until September 3, 2020 to migrate to the preferred attributes.
* More information about these deprecations can be found in the description of [#182](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-tfe/pull/182)
* d/tfe_workspace_ids: The deprecation warning for the `ids` attribute will not go away until the attribute is removed in a future version.
This is due to a [limitation of the 1.0 version of the Terraform SDK](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/7569) for deprecation warnings on attributes that aren't specified in a configuration.
If you have already changed all references to this data source's `ids` attribute to the new `full_names` attribute, you can ignore the warning.


## 0.17.1 (May 27, 2020)

BUG FIXES:
* r/tfe_team: Fixed a panic occurring with importing Owners teams on Free TFC organizations which do not include visible organization access. ([#181](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-tfe/pull/181))

  and `trigger_prefixes` ([[#138](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-tfe/pull/138)]) when removed from the configuration.
  Special note: if you have workspaces which are configured through the TFE provider, but have set the working directory or trigger prefixes manually, through the UI, you'll need to update your configuration.

## 0.14.0 (February 20, 2020)

FEATURES:

* **New Resource:** `tfe_run_trigger` ([[#132](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-tfe/pull/132)])

## 0.13.0 (February 18, 2020)

ENHANCEMENTS:

* provider: Update to the standalone SDK ([[#130](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-tfe/pull/130)])

## 0.12.1 (February 12, 2020)
